# Human-Algorithmic Interaction Using a Large Language Model-Augmented Artificial Intelligence Clinical Decision Support System(2024)

Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical decision support systems (CDSS) poses a socio-technological challenge that is impacted by usability, trust, and human-computer interaction (HCI). AI-CDSS interventions have shown limited benefit in clinical outcomes, which may be due to insufficient understanding of how health-care providers interact with AI systems. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance AI-CDSS, but haven’t been studied in either simulated or real-world clinical scenarios. We present findings from a randomized controlled trial deploying AI-CDSS for the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with and without an LLM interface within realistic clinical simulations for physician and medical student participants. We find evidence that LLM augmentation improves ease-of-use, that LLM-generated responses with citations improve trust, and HCI varies based on clinical expertise. Qualitative themes from interviews suggest the perception of LLM-augmented AI-CDSS as a team-member used to confirm initial clinical intuitions and help evaluate borderline decisions.

# A diagnostic support system based on pain drawings: binary and k-disease classification of EDS, GBS, FSHD, PROMM, and a control group with Pain2D(2023)


## Abstract

### Background and objective

The diagnosis of rare diseases (RDs) is often challenging due to their rarity, variability and the high number of individual RDs, resulting in a delay in diagnosis with adverse effects for patients and healthcare systems. The development of computer assisted diagnostic decision support systems could help to improve these problems by supporting differential diagnosis and by prompting physicians to initiate the right diagnostic tests. Towards this end, we developed, trained and tested a machine learning model implemented as part of the software called Pain2D to classify four rare diseases (EDS, GBS, FSHD and PROMM), as well as a control group of unspecific chronic pain, from pen-and-paper pain drawings filled in by patients.

### Methods

Pain drawings (PDs) were collected from patients suffering from one of the four RDs, or from unspecific chronic pain. The latter PDs were used as an outgroup in order to test how Pain2D handles more common pain causes. A total of 262 (59 EDS, 29 GBS, 35 FSHD, 89 PROMM, 50 unspecific chronic pain) PDs were collected and used to generate disease specific pain profiles. PDs were then classified by Pain2D in a leave-one-out-cross-validation approach.

### Results

Pain2D was able to classify the four rare diseases with an accuracy of 61–77% with its binary classifier. EDS, GBS and FSHD were classified correctly by the Pain2D k-disease classifier with sensitivities between 63 and 86% and specificities between 81 and 89%. For PROMM, the k-disease classifier achieved a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of 90%.

### Conclusions

Pain2D is a scalable, open-source tool that could potentially be trained for all diseases presenting with pain.

# Digital Decision Support in Acute Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Addressing Clinical Variability and the Need for a Standardized Care Pathway(2026)

Problem to solve

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) requires rapid risk stratification, timely intervention decisions, and accurate triage. Despite validated risk scores (Rockall, Glasgow-Blatchford), substantial variability in clinical decision-making persists. CDSS interest is growing, yet no unified approach integrates prognostic models, endoscopic findings, and clinical parameters.

Key gaps include:

-   variability in therapeutic decisions across experience levels;
    
-   limited calibration of scores in high-risk patients;
    
-   absence of a standardized early triage and management pathway;
    
-   limited integration of guideline-based recommendations into routine workflow.
    

Innovation

A literature review (PubMed, Embase, Scopus; 2018-2025) assessed:

-   prognostic value of Rockall and GBS for rebleeding, mortality, and urgent intervention;
    
-   management algorithms for non-variceal GIB;
    
-   existing digital tools and CDSS components;
    
-   factors driving decision-making variability.
    

Non-clinical, low-quality, and non-representative studies were excluded.The review highlights the potential of digital CDSS to integrate clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic parameters into a structured and standardized decision pathway.

Results 1. Risk score performance.

-   GBS shows high sensitivity for identifying low-risk patients (GBS 0-1=minimal adverse event risk).
    
-   Rockall score offers acceptable accuracy for rebleeding prediction (AUC≈0.73) but is less reliable for mortality.
    
-   Both tools insufficiently incorporate real-time endoscopy and dynamic hemodynamics.
    

2. Clinical gaps.

-   large decision variability;
    
-   weak calibration in high-risk groups;
    
-   lack of unified triage pathway;
    
-   limited incorporation of guidelines into workflow.
    

3. Potential of digital CDSS.

CDSS studies show improved structure of clinical decisions, better adherence to recommendations, greater consistency across clinicians, and reduced assessment time.No validated GIB-specific digital model currently integrates endoscopic, clinical, and dynamic parameters.

Conclusions Rockall and GBS remain important but fail to incorporate endoscopic stigmata and dynamic patient changes. Persistent gaps – decision variability, absence of standardized triage, and limited implementation of guidelines – underline the need for updated digital solutions.

Digital CDSS represent a promising direction for standardizing GIB management. The literature supports developing multifactorial algorithms that combine laboratory, clinical, and endoscopic data.

Future Directions.

Future work should focus on developing and validating digital CDSS, including web-based and EMR-integrated tools, capable of real-time adaptation and reducing clinician variability. Integration within the ESGE framework could support the creation of a unified standardized pathway for GIB management.


# Achieving Value by Risk Stratification with Machine Learning Model or Clinical Risk Score in Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: A Cost Minimization Analysis(2025)

## Abstract

### Introduction:

We estimate the economic impact of applying risk assessment tools to identify very-low-risk patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) who can be safely discharged from the emergency department using a cost minimization analysis.

### Methods:

We compare triage strategies (Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS)=0/0–1 or validated machine-learning model) to usual care using a Markov chain model from a U.S. healthcare payer perspective.

### Results:

Over 5 years, the GBS triage strategy produced national cumulative savings over usual care of over $2.7 billion, and the machine-learning strategy of over $3.4 billion.

### Conclusion:

Implementing risk assessment models for UGIB reduces costs, thereby increasing value.

**Clinical decision support improves autoimmune/paraneoplastic antibody panel utilization**(2025)

## Abstract

Objectives

Selection of autoimmune/paraneoplastic antibody panels remains challenging because health-care professionals often lack familiarity with panel contents, recommended specimen types, and antibody combinations for a given patient. Inappropriate use adds cost, prompts unnecessary additional workup, and delays the identification of the true cause of patient symptoms. In this study, we assessed whether order-entry clinical decision support can improve autoimmune/paraneoplastic antibody panel utilization.

Methods

An order-entry clinical decision support tool was embedded in the electronic health record system. Using a nested panel structure, the decision support tool prompted clinicians to identify their patient’s clinical presentation and guided selection of the appropriate tests. In addition, the tool featured a duplicate checking function to alert clinicians when placing multiple orders with substantially similar antibody content within a 3-month period. Panel ordering practices were assessed during the 12 months before implementation and compared with the 6 months immediately following implementation.

Results

Clinical decision support significantly reduced the monthly test volume of all orderables from 75.8 per month before implementation to 54.5 per month after implementation (incident rate ratio [IRR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.63-0.81;  _P _< .001). Placement of multiple orders for panels with substantially overlapping antibody content also decreased significantly, from 7.0 per month to 1.2 per month (IRR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.33;  _P _< .001). The number of neural-specific antibodies detected remained unchanged, but the reduction in total test volume increased the neural-specific antibody positivity rate from 4.2% to 6.8% (IRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.94-2.70;  _P _= .075).

Conclusions

Order-entry clinical decision support offers an efficient and effective approach to improve the utilization of autoimmune/paraneoplastic antibody panels.

# Genomic characterization of the Guillain-Barre syndrome-associated Campylobacter jejuni ICDCCJ07001 Isolate

## Abstract

Campylobacter jejuni ICDCCJ07001 (HS:41, ST2993) was isolated from a Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) patient during a 36-case GBS outbreak triggered by C. jejuni infections in north China in 2007. Sequence analysis revealed that the ICDCCJ07001 genome consisted of 1,664,840 base pairs (bp) and one tetracycline resistance plasmid of 44,084 bp. The GC content was 59.29% and 1,579 and 37 CDSs were identified on the chromosome and plasmid, respectively. The ICDCCJ07001 genome was compared to C. jejuni subsp. jejuni strains 81-176, 81116, NCTC11168, RM1221 and C. jejuni subsp. doylei 269.97. The length and organization of ICDCCJ07001 was similar to that of NCTC11168, 81-176 and 81-116 except that CMLP1 had a reverse orientation in strain ICDCCJ07001. Comparative genomic analyses were also carried out between GBS-associated C. jejuni strains. Thirteen common genes were present in four GBS-associated strains and 9 genes mapped to the LOS cluster and the ICDCCJ07001_pTet (44 kb) plasmid was mosaic in structure. Thirty-seven predicted CDS in ICDCCJ07001_pTet were homologous to genes present in three virulence-associated plasmids in Campylobacter: 81-176_pTet, pCC31 and 81-176_pVir. Comparative analysis of virulence loci and virulence-associated genes indicated that the LOS biosynthesis loci of ICDCCJ07001 belonged to type A, previously reported to be associated with cases of GBS. The polysaccharide capsular biosynthesis (CPS) loci and the flagella modification (FM) loci of ICDCCJ07001 were similar to corresponding sequences of strain 260.94 of similar serotype as strain ICDCCJ07001. Other virulence-associated genes including cadF, peb1, jlpA, cdt and ciaB were conserved between the C. jejuni strains examined.

**Expanding our understanding of Guillain–Barré syndrome: Recent advances and clinical implications**(2024)

## Abstract

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare yet potentially life-threatening disorder of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), characterized by substantial clinical heterogeneity. Although classified as an autoimmune disease, the immune mechanisms underpinning distinct GBS subtypes remain largely elusive. Traditionally considered primarily antibody-mediated, the pathophysiology of GBS lacks clarity, posing challenges in the development of targeted and effective treatments. Nevertheless, recent investigations have substantially expanded our understanding of the disease, revealing an involvement of autoreactive T cell immunity in a major subtype of GBS patients and opening new biomedical perspectives. This review highlights these discoveries and offers a comprehensive overview of current knowledge about GBS, including ongoing challenges in disease management.

# Hospital Coordination and Protocols Using Serum and Peripheral Blood Cells from Patients and Healthy Donors in a Longitudinal Study of Guillain–Barré Syndrome(2025)


## Abstract

**Background/Objectives:**  Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare autoimmune peripheral neuropathy that affects both the myelin sheaths and axons of the peripheral nervous system. It is the leading cause of acute neuromuscular paralysis worldwide, with an annual incidence of less than two cases per 100,000 people. Although most patients recover, a small proportion do not regain mobility and even remain dependent on mechanical ventilation. In this study, we refer to the analysis of samples collected from GBS patients at different defined time points during hospital recovery and performed by a medical or research group.  **Methods:**  The conditions for whole blood collection, peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation, and serum collection from GBS patients and volunteer donors are explained. Aliquots of these human samples have been used for red blood cell phenotyping, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, and serum biochemical parameter studies.  **Results:**  The initial sporadic preservation of human samples from GBS patients and control volunteers enabled the creation of a biobank collection for current and future studies related to the diagnosis and treatment of GBS.  **Conclusions:**  In this article, we describe the laboratory procedures and the integration of a GBS biobank collection, local medical services, and academic institutions collaborating in its respective field. The report establishes the intra-disciplinary and inter-institutional network to conduct long-term longitudinal studies on GBS.
